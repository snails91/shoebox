<question>
  <span class="deco2"> ➱ why is this archive here?</span> 
  <p style="margin-left:100px; margin-right: 100px;"> This archive started with a bin of hundreds of Kolorama picture slides. Each picture in this box of trashed slides was considered; for a moment, the photographer really thought about what they were taking a picture of. In the modern 2026 day, taking a picture is not a difficult excercise. In fact, for many it has become second nature. this archive is meant to gather data and reflections on how the lack of <span style="font-style: italic;">friction</span> in taking a picture might affect our relationships with the content itself. </p>

<question>
  <span class="deco2"> ➱ what have you noticed so far?</span>
  <p style="margin-left:100px; margin-right: 100px;"> I've noticed that many people feel the tension between how taking a picture can preserve and honor that which matters most to us, but also how the "pictures or it never happened" mindset place picture above reality, in public and private spaces. This is highlighted by the types of pictures visitors submit, espescially childhood photos. They check both the memory and aesthetic boxes.</p>
